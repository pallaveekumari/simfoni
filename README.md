## Lessons Learned

- I became proficient in reading and understanding the code.
- I learn about many new things in react and Material UI that I didn't know before.
- My skills in React,ES6,DOM Manipulation became better.
- My code writing style became cleaner as i used ES6 and React to write code and used import export so that code become well structured.
